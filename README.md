# PervasiveComputing-ClothingID
Project for our Pervasive Computing class in UNI. Implemented a clothing identification application using MATLAB 2019b. Created a GUI that made use of hardware/sensor (camera) and made use of a neural network for identification of items pointed toward the sensor. Created our own library to train our neural network.
